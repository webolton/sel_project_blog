## How We Got Here and Where We're Going

After another disappointing academic job search, I finally threw in the towel and decided to try my hand at something new. I gave up my adjunct teaching position at [La Salle University](http://www.lasalle.edu/){:target='_blank'} in the spring, took an intensive programming boot camp with [NYCDA](https://nycda.com/){:target='_blank'} over the summer, and in September I landed a job as a software developer at [Neomind Labs](http://www.neomindlabs.com/){:target='_blank'}, a small [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/){:target='_blank'} shop here in Philly. Now that I am starting to get my bearings after all of the change, I have turned my attention back to my project, the [Digital South English Legendary](http://digitalsel.org/){:target='_blank'}.

My plan is to completely reboot my original DigitalSEL project site, this time taking what I know about Rails development, and turn the concept into a sophisticated web application / digital edition. The potential for programmatic approaches to the humanities is profound and I am hoping that I can use the project to advance both the study of medieval hagiography and the digital humanities.

Besides some planning, discussion, and sketching of data structure, my first step with the project is this blog. My plan is to document every step of the project, both to help me keep track of my process, and also to provide a record that might be helpful to others. Besides my hope for the final project, I want whatever work I do on the project to be helpful for other scholars who find themselves in a similar position, trying to do high-quality scholarship in â€œalt-academia."
