## Hi! I am a medievalist and software developer.

I earned my PhD from Arizona State University in English literature, where I focused on early medieval lives of saints and English legal history. I have taught a variety of composition, literature, and linguistics courses and have published essays and presented papers on topics in early English and Latin literature ranging from Ã†lfric of Eysham to Spenser. [Download my CV](/downloads/bolton_cv.pdf) for the specifics of my acadmemic work, and my [GitHub](https://github.com/webolton){:target='_blank'} account for my programming career.

Presently, I am a software developer at a small Ruby on Rails firm, [Neomind Labs](http://www.neomindlabs.com/){:target='_blank'}, here in beautiful Philadelphia, PA. I live with my wife, [Sara Wachter-Boettcher](http://www.sarawb.com/){:target='_blank'}, and two large cats.

The [DigitalSEL](http://digitalsel.org/){:target='_blank'} is an effort to bring my professional work in programing to bear on my academic research interests. My goal is to present a first-rate edition of the *SEL* that uses both a digital format and sophistocated programming to help scholars think about medieval texts and textual studies in new and enlightening ways.
