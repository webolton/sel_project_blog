# About the Digital South English Legendary

The DigitalSEL is a digital humanities project aiming to edit all known versions of the *South English Legendary*, a large and complicated collection of saintsâ€™ legends that circulated in England from the late-thirteenth to the mid-sixteenth centuries.

My goal with the project is to present expertly edited versions of every manuscript witness of the *SEL* in a way that allows readers to compare the various forms of the *SEL*. My hope is to advance the way we think about how to make editions and do textual studies by challenging and complicating how we study and visualize textual reception.

Right now, the project exits as a static JavaScript application that I made when I first started thinking about programming as a useful tool for doing textual analysis and making textual editions. My goal is to take what I have learned in my current profession as a software developer, and refine and expand the project into a much more sophisticated application.
